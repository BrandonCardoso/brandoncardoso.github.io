        Nordstrom is a leading fashion retailer focused on delivering
        the best possible shopping experience for their customers.
        <br /><br />
        After Nordstrom acquired BevyUp, I was hired by Nordstrom Canada where I
        continued to develop the application that was started at BevyUp.
        My main focus was integration of BevyUp's resources (databases,
        pipelines, documentation, repositories, etc.) with Nordstrom's,
        as well as improving system reliability and monitoring.

        BevyUp empowers sales associates with unique tools and insights
        that put the focus back on the customer with technology that
        enables them to create meaningful relationships that drives improved
        business results.
        <br /><br />
        I worked at BevyUp for 3 years. During my time working there, the focus
        of the company pivoted several times to meet customer demand, and I had
        to develop a knowledge of the entire system. I worked on everything from
        UI/UX to database design, and helped with the initial design and
        implementation of the product that would lead to the acquisition by
        Nordstrom. I'm deeply grateful for my time at BevyUp; the wonderful
        people I met and worked with, and the experience I gained.

        BevyUp was acquired by Nordstrom in March, 2018.

        At RP4K, kids learn the fundamentals of computer programming while
        creating a video game in an informal classroom setting.
        <br /><br />
        I worked as an instructor at Real Programming 4 Kids for over a year,
        teaching kids that were as young as 8 and up to 16. Courses came in
        a variety of programming languages like Scratch, Visual Basic, C#,
        and Java. I taught kids the basic programming principles and math
        required to create games similar to Frogger, Asteroids, and Mario,
        and even how to create mods for Minecraft.
